[Eclipse Kuksa](https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/) includes an open and secure cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via open in-car and Internet connection and is supported by an integrated open source software development ecosystem. The Eclipse Kuksa project conatins a set of repositories and this repo is one among those that contains in-vehicle platform code and also contains required layers and bindings to build a Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) distribution. The in-vehicle platform is primarily designed to work with AGL. However the individual components found in [this repo](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle) could be used on other platforms as well.
